# Purpose of the analysis

Analyzed Transport for London (TfL) journey data to uncover insights about public transportation usage in London. The analysis focuses on trends across different transport types, seasonal patterns, and the impact of external events like the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Key Insights
1. Bus services are the most utilized, with 24,905.19 million journeys.
2. Underground & DLR follows with 15,020.47 million journeys.
3. Overground ranks third with 1,666.85 million journeys.

## Yearly Trends
- Total journeys peaked in 2015 at 3,752.51 million.
- A significant drop occurred in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
- As of 2022, total journeys remain 17% below the 2019 level.

## Transport-Specific Trends
- Underground and Overground services showed steady or slight increases year-over-year pre-pandemic.
- Bus ridership has been declining since 2015, with a steeper drop in 2020.
- Post-pandemic recovery is evident but not complete across all transport types.

## Statistical Distribution

- Journey counts exhibit a left-skewed, positive distribution.
- The median journey count is higher than the mean, indicating that typical usage is higher than average usage.

## Variability Analysis

- Bus and Underground & DLR networks show the highest standard deviations, indicating significant ridership volatility.
- Tram and Bus services offer the most predictable ridership patterns relative to their mean usage.
- TfL Rail and Emirates Airline show high relative variability, suggesting less predictable ridership.

## Recommendations
- Implement adaptive scheduling strategies for Bus and Underground services to accommodate high variability.
- Investigate factors contributing to declining bus ridership, such as delays, routes, costs, and customer satisfaction.
- Develop robust forecasting methods for services with high relative variability, particularly TfL Rail and Emirates Airline.
- Focus on bringing ridership back to pre-pandemic levels, especially for Underground and Bus services.
- Utilize the insights from this analysis to inform policy decisions and service improvements across the TfL network.
  
## Future Work
- Analyze factors influencing bus ridership decline.
- Investigate the impact of special events and seasonal variations on journey patterns.
- Conduct a detailed study on the post-pandemic recovery of different transport types.
